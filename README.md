# SMTBot

This is a discord bot made to play the niche JRPG Shin Megami Tensei!
Made by Boncers and TheGrungler!!

+SMTbot.py
  This file is the same as "main()". It outlines the slash commands the bot itself takes in and handles messages to the server.

+SMT.py
  This file acts as a module that holds the classes and functions that are directly related to game aspects.
  
+EZ.py
  Name TBD... This file also acts as a module. I wanted to declutter SMTbot.py as much as possible so I pushed the functions not directly related to the game here. 
  
If you find this github I hope the bot is fun and to your liking! You are more than welcome to send pull requests to improve our code if you want!
